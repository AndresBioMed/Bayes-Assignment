Before running the Jupyter notebook, make sure you have the same packages as I. For that, download the *environment.yml* file, open the terminal (or Anaconda prompt), and write:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate MMRES_UPF
```
Remember to use this (MMRES_UPF) environment to run the Jupyter Notebook
